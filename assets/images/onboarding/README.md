# Onboarding Images - Placeholder Guide

The following images should be added to `assets/images/onboarding/`:

1. **logo.png** (120x120px)
   - Sachio Mobile Toilets logo
   - Should be the main brand mark

2. **brand.png** (200x140px)
   - Brand introduction illustration
   - Shows cleanliness + reliability themes
   - Use teal (#0B6E6B) and gold (#F6B22F) accents

3. **cta.png** (200x140px)
   - Call-to-action illustration
   - Shows buy/rent options
   - Visual representation of product choices

4. **track.png** (200x140px)
   - Delivery tracking illustration
   - Shows map + driver location
   - Conveys real-time tracking concept

**How to generate these:**
- Use Figma to export PNG files (recommended)
- Or use an online image generator (e.g., Midjourney, DALL-E, Canva)
- Or use placeholder SVG components temporarily

**Temporary workaround:** Comment out image imports in onboarding screens and add a placeholder View with backgroundColor.

For now, the onboarding screens reference these paths. Replace them with actual images when ready.
